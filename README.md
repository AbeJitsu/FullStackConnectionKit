# FullStackConnectionKit

## Overview

This project, 'FullStackConnectionKit', is a monorepo setup designed to serve as a boilerplate for MEVN (MongoDB, Express, Vue, Node.js) stack applications. It provides a structured foundation for developing full-stack web applications with a clear separation between client and server code. This starter kit aims to streamline the initial setup process and ensure proper connections between the frontend, backend, and database from the outset of development.
